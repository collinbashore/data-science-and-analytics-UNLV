# Course #2: Statistics & Probability
This course covered fundamental statistical topics such as descriptive statistics, probability, sampling methods, hypothesis testing, and linear regression. The skiils/learning objectives in this course are as follows:

- Calculate descriptive statistics to describe a distribution
- Demonstate the rules of probability
- Describe and institute sampling methods for different testing outcomes
- Perform a variey of hypothesis tests
- Conduct advanced testing methods such as ANOVA, Chi-Squared Test, and F-Tests
- Created a simple linear regression model

### Activity: [Calculating Z-Scores and Theoretical Sample Size for a Single Proportion of Mrs. Diaz's class](https://github.com/collinbashore/data-analytics-portfolio/tree/main/Statistics%20%26%20Probability)

- Calculated z-scores of raw test scores in Mrs. Diaz's class.
- Calculated the theoretical sample size Mrs. Diaz's will need to conduct a survey on student's study habits and test scores. These calculation was performed using the formula for the sample size for a single proportion given the sample proportion, confidence interval, and margin of error using Excel and Python
- The Excel and Jupyter Notebook files for this activity are located above the README.md file!
