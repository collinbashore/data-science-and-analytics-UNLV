## SQL & Databases
This course covered the following topics/learning objectives:
- Reading, writing, and interpreting SQL queries
- Converting user requirements into an efficient SQL query that extracts the right data
- Using a variety of SQL statements to query, update, insert, or delete data
- Using aggregate and summary functions when querying data

#### Tools/Software used:
- [MySQL (most recent version)](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html) for Windows
- [MYSQL Workbench (most recent version)](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) for Windows

#### [Project: Analyzing Data for Drop Table Records using MySQL](https://github.com/collinbashore/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20%26%20Databases/Collin%20Bashore's%20SQL%20Final%20Project.sql)

 - Wrote and implemented SQL queries as a Data Analyst at Drop Table Records
 - Created database schema and imported files into MySQL.
 - Ran queries based on record release dates and bands that featured specific criteria (drummers).
 - Added new bands to correct tables (building relationships between tables).
 - Determined high and average price of current merchandise.
 - Added new value (performance venue) to database.
 - Created dashboard views that displayed specified information.
 - Created stored procedure specifying instrument, player and availability.
 - Added band value of my choosing and their information to database, including band table, gig table and player table.
 - Successfully added, manipulated, and analyzed data using SQL database and MySQL

## Statistics & Probability
This course covered fundamental statistical topics such as descriptive statistics, probability, sampling methods, hypothesis testing, and linear regression.

#### Tools/Software used:
- Excel
- Python (for Activity)
- Jupyter Notebook (For Activity)


#### [Activity: Calculating Z-Scores and Theoretical Sample Size for a Single Proportion](https://github.com/collinbashore/data-analytics-portfolio/tree/main/Statistics%20%26%20Probability)

- Calculated z-scores of raw test scores in Mrs. Diaz's class.
- Calculated the theoretical sample size Mrs. Diaz's will need to conduct a survey on student's study habits and test scores. This calculation was performed using the formula for the sample size for a single proportion given the sample proportion, confidence interval, and margin of error using Excel and Python
- Calculations were performed using both Excel and Python (files are stored in the "Statistics & Probability" folder or by clicking the link stored in the Activity title).


## Data Storytelling
This course covered important concepts of data storytelling such as developing a story arc, communicating data insights based on audience and stakeholders, choosing elements of a story that are most effective for a given scenario, and report writing.


#### [Activity: Petra's Place Audience](https://github.com/collinbashore/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Storytelling/4.4.3%20Activity%20(2).pdf)
- Created a storytelling arc for different audiences
- Identified target audiences for Petra's Place based on the profession or skill level of the audience.
- Implemented a strategy to reach out to each of the different target audiences.
- Planned a data storytelling presentation for each of the target audiences.


## Milestone Project 1: Analyzing Stars Data for the Elonians
In this first Milestone Project, I analyzed the Stars dataset as a Data Scientist working at a Space Research Company named AWAY (Aliens Where Are You). I was tasked to determine which yellow dwarf stars are similar to the Sun that supports life on Earth based on characteristics such as Absolute Magnitude, Radius, Luminosity, and Color. The goal is to find yellow dwarf stars nearby other planets that have similar characteristics to that of the Sun. Those planets that surround other dwarf stars are known to support alien lifeforms, which is crucial for finding a potential home planet for various groups of alien species, and humans.

The methods used to complete this project involved the following:
- Cleaning/wrangling the Stars dataset using Excel
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL
- Using statistical methods in Excel (Data Analysis ToolPak) to gather data insights
- Planning a report
- Developing a data story  

#### Skills utilized:
- Excel
- SQL
- Data Storytelling
- Report writing
