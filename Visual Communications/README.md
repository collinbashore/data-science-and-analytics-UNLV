## Project: 2022-2023 Fuel Economy Dashboards (collaboration project)

## Background
This project focuses on the fuel economy of all plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles for both 2022 ad 2023 vehicle models.

## Project contribution
Myself
 - Created the dashboard for plug-in hybrid vehicles
 
Partner
 - Created the dashboard for all-electric vehicles
 
Both
 - Dashboard brainstorming and data wrangling/cleaning
 
## Goals/Objectives
* Create two dashboards for each of the vehicle types (plug-in hybrid vehicles and all-electric vehicles)
* Calculate the average annual fuel cost, average greenhouse gas (GHG) Rating, and average amount spent/saved over 5-year period for each vehicle type.
    - Calculations included both 2022 and 2023 models

## Conclusion
 - The all-electric vehicles are the most cleanest and contribute less $CO_2$ emissions
 - Tesla and Toyota vehicles have the highest combined city and hwy MPG
 - Electric vehicles save more on fuel costs than plug-in hybrid vehicles since they contribute less $CO_2$ emissions
