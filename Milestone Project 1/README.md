# Milestone Project 1: Analyzing Star's Data for the Elonians
In this first Milestone Project, I analyzed the Stars dataset as a Data Scientist working at a Space Research Company named AWAY (Aliens Where Are You). I was tasked to determine which yellow dwarf stars are similar to the Sun that supports life on Earth based on characteristics such as Absolute Magnitude, Radius, Luminosity, and Color. The goal is to find yellow dwarf stars nearby other planets that have similar characteristics to that of the Sun, which is crucial for finding a potential home planet for various groups of alien species, and humans.

The methods/skills utilized to complete this project involved the following:
- Cleaning/wrangling the Stars dataset on Excel
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL
- Using Statistical Methods in Excel (Data Analysis ToolPak) to gather data insights
- Planning a report
- Developing a data story
